# The land cover paradox: Characteristics of blue- and green spaces within and beyond high-risk suicide clusters

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a comprehensive spatial epidemiology study examining the relationship between urban greenspace characteristics, environmental and sociodemographic factors, and suicide risk in Chicago census block groups (CBGs) from 2023â€“2024. The project combines descriptive epidemiology, spatial statistics, Bayesian modeling, and geospatial data science to identify and interpret neighborhood-level suicide risk patterns.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To model and map spatial variation in suicide incidence across Chicago using land cover diversity, park access, tree equity, social vulnerability, and other built-environment indicators.

**Methods**:
- Descriptive epidemiology and visual analytics of Medical Examiner death data
- Spatial Poisson and BYM models (INLA and CARBayes)
- Interaction testing and exceedance probability mapping
- Geovisualizations of high-risk clusters and built environment characteristics
- Partial dependence plots (PDPs) to evaluate marginal and moderated effects

## Data Sources

- Cook County Medical Examiner Suicide Deaths (2023â€“2024)
- NLCD Land Cover and Land Cover Diversity
- Urban Tree Canopy and Tree Equity Index
- Park Priority Index and park access buffers
- SafeGraph Travel Times to Amenities
- Area Deprivation Index (ADI), American Community Survey (ACS)
- Custom shapefiles for environmental exposures

## Key Features

- **Classification of Suicide Mechanisms**: Categorized deaths by means (e.g., gunshot, hanging, overdose) using regex-based NLP on narrative fields.
- **Land Cover Diversity Index**: Simpsonâ€™s Diversity Index calculated across 7 NLCD categories and undeveloped land.
- **Built Environment Indicators**: Tree canopy, park acreage within 15 minutes, tree and park priority indices.
- **Environmental Stressors**: Heat anomalies, temperature, unemployment, linguistic isolation, and health burden.
- **Modeling Framework**:
  - Poisson GLMs for baseline associations
  - Spatial autocorrelation (Moranâ€™s I, LISA clusters)
  - Spatial BYM models using INLA
  - Sensitivity-tested spatial models using CARBayes
  - Exceedance probability maps for identifying high-risk CBGs
- ðŸ“Š **Interaction Effects**: Examined how land cover diversity moderates open space, tree equity, blue space, poverty, and racial composition effects.
